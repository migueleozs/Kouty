# Unity3D generated meta files
# These are essential for Unity to track assets and should be committed!

# Cache files for Unity editor
# These files are often huge and specific to your local setup, so they should be ignored.
# The `Library/PackageCache/` is specifically causing your "large file" errors.

# Custom ignore patterns for common temporary/generated files
# Add any other specific files or folders you want to ignore here.
# For example, if you have a "builds" folder that Unity doesn't directly manage:
# /builds/

# Asset Store / Package Manager generated files (often contain downloaded assets)
# These are typically large and can be re-downloaded by Unity.

# If you have specific folders for downloaded assets that shouldn't be version controlled:
# /Assets/DownloadedAssets/ # Example if you store large downloads here

# MacOS specific files
.DS_Store

# Windows specific files
